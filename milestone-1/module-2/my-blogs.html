    <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Travelling Hero</span></small>
    <p>The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a two-level road-rail bridge across the Padma River,
        the main distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh.
        It connects Shariatpur and Madaripur, 
        linking the southwest of the country to the northern and eastern regions.
        The bridge was inaugurated on 25 June 2022.
        Considered to be the most challenging construction project in the history of Bangladesh,
        the steel truss bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single track railway on a lower level.
        The bridge consists of 41 sections,
         each 150.12 m (492.5 ft) long and 22.5 m (74 ft) wide,
          with a total length of 6.241 km (3.878 mi).
         It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh, 
         the longest bridge over the river Ganges by both span and total length, 
        and features the highest pile depth of any bridge in the world at 120 m (390 ft).
        The bridge, when commissioned,is expected to boost the GDP of Bangladesh by as much as 1.2 percent.</p>
